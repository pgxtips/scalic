# Scalic Rope Data Structure Implementation

This is a simple implementation of the Rope data structure for the Scalic text editor. 
The Rope data structure is a binary tree that is used to store large strings efficiently. 
It is particularly useful when you need to perform a lot of concatenation operations on 
large strings.

## What needs to be done next

- [x] Implement the `Rope` data structure.
- [x] Implement the `Rope` data structure tests.
- [ ] Implement the `Rope` data structure documentation.
- [ ] Implement the `Rope` data structure benchmarks.
- [ ] Implement the `Rope` data structure optimizations.
- [ ] Implement the `Rope` data structure optimizations tests.
- [ ] Implement the `Rope` data structure optimizations documentation.
- [ ] Optimize the `Rope` data structure so that it can open "src/tests/test_data/multi_line_large.txt".


## Notes

- This is not a refined implementation of the Rope data structure.
- The implementation is not optimized for performance.
- The implementation is not thread-safe.
- The implementation is not memory efficient.
- The implementation is not space efficient.
- The implementation is not balanced.
- The implementation is not optimized for memory allocation.
- The implementation is not optimized for memory deallocation.
- The implementation is not optimized for memory reallocation.
